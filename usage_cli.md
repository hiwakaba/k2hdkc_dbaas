# Usage
Describes how to use **K2HDKC DBaaS CLI** (Command Line Interface).  
**K2HDKC DBaaS CLI** (Command Line Interface) works with [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) components and [K2HR3](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/) systems.  

**K2HDKC DBaaS CLI** (Command Line Interface) works as a plug-in for [K2HR3 CLI](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/cli.html).

This section describes how to create, scale, and delete **K2HDKC clusters** with the **K2HDKC DBaaS CLI** (Command Line Interface), and how to start automated K2HDKC slave nodes.

## 1. Install
**K2HDKC DBaaS CLI** is provided as a package at [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/app/antpickax/stable/search?q=k2hdkc-dbaas-cli).  

The following explains how to install it as a package.  
To expand and use the source code, refer to [k2hdkc_dbaas_cli repository](https://github.com/yahoojapan/k2hdkc_dbaas_cli).  

### 1.1. Before installing
First, set the repository for `packagecloud.io`.  
```
$ curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/antpickax/stable/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
  or
$ curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/antpickax/stable/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
```

### 1.2. Install pacakges
Then install the **K2HDKC DBaaS CLI** package.  
```
$ apt install k2hdkc-dbaas-cli
  or
$ yum install k2hdkc-dbaas-cli
```
_Please use each command from the package manager according to your OS environment._  

**K2HDKC DBaaS CLI** is a plugin for [K2HR3 CLI](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/cli.html), then the [K2HR3 CLI](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/cli.html) package will also be installed.  

### 1.3. Verification
Execute the following command to check if the installation is successful.  
```
$ k2hr3 --version

K2HDKC DBaaS Command Line Interface - 1.0.0(26cdbcc)

Copyright 2021 Yahoo! Japan Corporation.

The K2HDKC DBaaS CLI (Command Line Interface of Database as a
Service for K2HDKC) is a tool for building a K2HDKC cluster
in conjunction with K2HR3.
The Trove version of K2HDKC DBaaS is available, but this
K2HDKC DBaaS CLI allows you to build K2HDKC clusters without
the need for a Trove system.
With the basic components of OpenStack and the K2HR3 system
that works with it, you can easily build a K2HD KC cluster
using the K2HDKC DBaaS CLI.

This software is released under the MIT License.
```
There is no problem if the version numbers of **K2HDKC DBaaS CLI** and [K2HR3 CLI](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/cli.html) are displayed.  

## 2. K2HDKC DBaaS CLI commands
**K2HDKC DBaaS CLI** is a plugin for [K2HR3 CLI](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/cli.html), so use the `k2hr3` program to run **K2HDKC DBaaS CLI**.  
The function as **K2HDKC DBaaS CLI** is provided by `database` which is one subcommand of [K2HR3 CLI](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/cli.html).  

You can see the function of the subcommand of **K2HDKC DBaaS CLI** as follows.
```
$ k2hr3 database --help
```
See Help for how to use each `database` subcommand.  

## 3. K2HDKC DBaaS CLI preferences
**K2HDKC DBaaS CLI** works in conjunction with [K2HR3](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/index.html) and [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/).  

It is assumed that each system has already been built.  
For information on building [K2HR3](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/), see [here](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/setup_trial.html).  
Please build the [K2HR3](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/) system in advance so that it works with [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/).  

The **K2HDKC DBaaS CLI** command accesses the [K2HR3 REST API](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/api.html) on the [K2HR3](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/) system and the **Identity** URI on [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/).  
These URIs can be specified each time the command is executed, but this operation can be omitted by setting the URI as **K2HR3 CLI configuration** in advance.  
Set each URI as follows.  
```
$ /k2hr3 config set K2HR3CLI_API_URI https://localhost:3000
Succeed : Set "K2HR3CLI_API_URI: https://localhost:3000"

$ k2hr3 config set K2HR3CLI_OPENSTACK_IDENTITY_URI https://localhost/identity
Succeed : Set "K2HR3CLI_OPENSTACK_IDENTITY_URI: https://localhost/identity"
```
_Replace `https://localhost:3000` and `https://localhost/identity` with the `K2HR3 REST API URI` and the `OpenStack Identity URI`, respectively._
The following explanation is based on the assumption that these URIs are set.  

## 4. Build K2HDKC Cluster
This section describes the procedure for building a **K2HDKC cluster**(server node).

First, it is assumed that the [K2HR3](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/) system is linked with [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) and has the following common user name and tenant(project).  
- Username  
`demo`
- Tenant(Project) name  
`mytenant`

### 4.1. Tokens
To build a **K2HDKC cluster**, you first need a Scoped token for the [K2HR3](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/) system.  
And you will also need a Scoped token for [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/).  
These tokens can be specified for each command execution described below, but this operation can be omitted by setting them in advance as **K2HR3 CLI configuration**.  
Therefore, the following explanation shows an example that includes an option to store tokens in **K2HR3 CLI configuration**.  

#### 4.1.1. OpenStack Token
First, get the OpenStack Scoped token and store it in the **K2HR3 CLI configuration**.  
```
$ k2hr3 database openstack token --op_user demo --op_tenant demo --interactive --saveconfig
OpenStack User passphrase: ********
gAAAAABgYV-h9MUf_gmfKRjx5cOGilOzg7KCSjccDwoPsYYTIao8gyA_VAozAFRVnconTsYQNTxYe01OWD8bmi_zcoeFzTEmqalt0INtHgP4-XXXXdVKWPNJ7o41NMCk95Oz6f3h6IJZPjYeMItymRBclLXKF4NykELxwgBl6ZqK-Z5laTRY5Njw_v-6ulhR9EzPyGP_gDqU
```
In the above, by specifying the `--interactive(-i)` option, the passphrase is entered interactively instead of being entered on the command line.  

#### 4.1.2. K2HR3 Token
Then use the OpenStack tokens obtained above to get the K2HR3 Unscoped and Scoped tokens and store them in the **K2HR3 CLI Configuration**.  
K2HR3 Scoped tokens can also be obtained by specifying user credentials.  
For more information, see [here](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/cli_token.html).  

```
$ k2hr3 token create token_optoken --tenant demo --saveconfig
gAAAAABgYWFJDRoCI0R96YxUkbjE0A7b6OLIoZtkdC36yMvfkSha_1-zxOAmLYYYYWGJhk1O2ZV9FElRyCLvc5_8VNTJfh1HKk2ayANoDiv6LFk6O2DE40QXDR2yed70akOAUZNcJ_Dasbkt6OeSCMX6619OZ6fbpeYsingBC3-fY2XfPwQmc2QA4pFlzwsa34Di532MxtST
```

### 4.2. Set information for K2HDKC Cluster
Before creating the server node for the **K2HDKC cluster**, set the **K2HDKC cluster** information to the [K2HR3](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/) system.  

Execute the following command for the K2HDKC cluster to be created as `mycluster`.  
```
$ k2hr3 database create mycluster --dbaas_create_user k2hdkcuser
Succeed : Phase : Create "mycluster" Resource
Succeed : Phase : Create "mycluster/server" Resource
Succeed : Phase : Create "mycluster/slave" Resource
Succeed : Phase : Create "mycluster" Policy
Succeed : Phase : Create "mycluster" Role
Succeed : Phase : Create "mycluster/server" Role
Succeed : Phase : Create "mycluster/slave" Role
Succeed : Registration of cluster "mycluster" with K2HR3 is complete
```
The `k2hdkcuser` above is the execution user of the [k2hdkc](https://k2hdkc.antpick.ax/) and [chmpx](https://chmpx.antpick.ax/) processes running on the server node of the **K2HDKC cluster**.  
By executing this command, the RESOURCE, POLICY-RULE, and ROLE of [K2HR3](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/) are set appropriately.  
To check the information set in [K2HR3](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/), use the operation method of [here](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/usage_app.html).  

### 4.3. Check OpenStack information
The server node(`Virtual Machine`) of the **K2HDKC cluster** starts as an instance of the worked with [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/).  
The image name(or ID) and flavor name(or ID) are required to launch an instance of [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/).  
You can see the available image name(and ID) and flavor name(and ID) using the following command.  
```
$ k2hr3 database list images --json
[
    {
        "name": "my-ubuntu-2004-image",
        "id": "59aa4ab3-7e89-42fb-83f9-093d3c83737e"
    },
    {
        "name": "my-centos-8-image",
        "id": "fd4b4411-c6b8-4f0a-95d7-fe5a9dfbca5d"
    },
    {
        "name": "cirros-0.4.0-x86_64-disk",
        "id": "075035da-db6d-4b1c-bc8b-7570c505d618"
    }
]

$ k2hr3 database list flavors --json
[
    {
        "name": "m1.tiny",
        "id": "1"
    },
    {
        "name": "m1.small",
        "id": "2"
    },
    {
        "name": "m1.medium",
        "id": "3"
    },
    {
        "name": "m1.large",
        "id": "4"
    },
    {
        "name": "m1.xlarge",
        "id": "5"
    },
    {
        "name": "cirros256",
        "id": "c1"
    },
    {
        "name": "ds512M",
        "id": "d1"
    },
    {
        "name": "ds1G",
        "id": "d2"
    },
    {
        "name": "ds2G",
        "id": "d3"
    },
    {
        "name": "ds4G",
        "id": "d4"
    }
]
```
You can specify the image name and flavor name when starting the server node(`Virtual Machine`) of the **K2HDKC cluster** explained in the next chapter.  
However, it is better to specify the image ID and flavor ID instead of them for better performance.  

### 4.4. K2HDKC Server nodes
At the end of building the **K2HDKC cluster**, start the K2HDKC server node(`Virtual Machine`).  
Start it using the following command.  
As mentioned above, start by specifying the image ID and flavor ID.  

```
$ k2hr3 database add host server mycluster myserver1 --op_keypair demo --op_flavor_id d2 --op_image_id 59aa4ab3-7e89-42fb-83f9-093d3c83737e
Succeed : Add server host(myserver1 - "99c0d9e5-a050-45f8-829c-fee6975310ad") for mycluster cluster.
```
`--op_keypair demo` is a key pair for the `demo` user that has been set to [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) in advance.  

The above allows you to start the `myserver1` host as a server node for **K2HDKC cluster** `mycluster`.  
To start the server nodes for multiple **K2HDKC cluster**, repeat the above command, changing the host name.  

## 5. K2HDKC Slave nodes
Up to the above, the server node of **K2HDKC cluster** has been started.  
Here we start a slave node that connects to that server node.  
Execute the command as follows.  

```
$ k2hr3 database add host slave mycluster myslave1 --op_keypair demo --op_flavor_id d2 --op_image_id 59aa4ab3-7e89-42fb-83f9-093d3c83737e
Succeed : Add slave host(myslave1 - "0e358601-1a0f-4e43-a18a-28e7a9d14813") for mycluster cluster.
```
With the above, `myslave1` can be started as a slave node.  

## 6. Destroy nodes in K2HDKC Cluster
You can destroy the server node and slave node of the **K2HDKC cluster**.  
It can be executed with the following command.  

```
$ k2hr3 database delete host mycluster myserver4
Succeed : Delete host myserver4 from mycluster cluster(OpenStack and K2HR3).
```
This command makes no distinction between server nodes and slave nodes.  
Any node can be destroyed simply by specifying the host name.  

## 7. Destroy K2HDKC Cluster
You can destroy all server nodes, slave nodes, and all configuration information in the **K2HDKC cluster**.  
It can be executed with the following command.  

```
$ k2hr3 database delete cluster mycluster
[IMPORTANT CONFIRM] You will lose all data/server in your cluster, Do you still want to run it? (y/n) y
[NOTICE] Delete all of the cluster configuration, data, cluster hosts, and so on.
Succeed : Delete all mycluster cluster(OpenStack and K2HR3).
```
In case of **K2HDKC cluster** deletion, you will be prompted for confirmation.  
If you do not want to see this prompt, run it with the `--yes(-y)` option.  

## 8. Summary
You can easily build a **K2HDKC cluster** on [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) by following steps 1 to 6 above.  
All you need is only [K2HR3](https://k2hr3.antpick.ax/) system that works with [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/).
